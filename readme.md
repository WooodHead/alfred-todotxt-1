# Simple wrapper for [Todo.txt](todotxt.com)

Supports all arguments/extentions. It's really just a wrapper.

## Dependencies

- [AlfredApp](http://www.alfredapp.com) + Powerpack
- [Todo.txt](http://www.todotxt.com)

## Setup

Download the [Todo.txt.alfredextension](https://github.com/madc/alfred-todotxt/raw/master/Todo.txt.alfredextension) from above and import it into Alfred. The extension should work with Todo.txt right away, if installed via [MacPorts](https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/office/todotxt/Portfile). Otherwise, TODOTXT_PATH has to be alterd to match the path, the todotxt is located.
